To remedy this situation, the Licktoads’ leader, His Mighty Girthness Chief Rendwattle Gutwad, has declared that the greatest heroes of the tribe must venture forth to retrieve the rest of the fireworks from a derelict ship stranded in the marsh. In order to prove themselves as the Licktoads’ bravest goblins, the PCs must complete a series of dangerous dares, from swallowing bull slugs and braving the dreaded Earbiter to dancing with Squealy Nord himself.

There’s a lot more than flashy graphics separating the old arcade classics from games like Titanfall.  The design of games has evolved rapidly over the years, often in fascinating ways.  This panel is about the historical developments in the practice of videogame design from 1978 until present.  We’ll talk about the three major periods in the history of game design: the arcade era, the composite era, and the set piece era.  The path from the original arcade classics to games like Diablo, Call of Duty and League of Legends is one of both gradual evolution as well as breakthrough ideas by designers like Shigeru Miyamoto.  We’ll even look at how design ideas from outside videogames seeped in and changed the landscape of design.  In particular, we’ll look how videogame designers struggled with the influence of Dungeons & Dragons, and went to extreme lengths to create their own distinct RPGs in the videogame medium.<br /><br />Questions and discussion are definitely invited!

In a world where we are trying to realize game potentials and undo years of negative press affection games offer a refreshing change. But, affection games are not all teddy bear hugs and sneaking kisses.
